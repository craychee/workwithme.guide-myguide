## Values

- I value **co-creation** above all else. I want to ensure that you feel I 
    [yes-and](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7183/the-yes-and-approach-less-ego-more-openness-more-possibility) you and
feel like you are yes-and-ing me in turn. No lone wolves. No heroes.
- I aspire to be **conscientious**. I want to do what I say I will do with care.
- I aspire to **invite curiosity** first into the new or unknown rather than
    respond with skepticism.
- The expression of **feelings and needs** are as important to me as the
    expression of ideas. I believe most problems in the software development
    cycle are due to a failure to properly express these other aspects.

## Personality

- I am **commanding**. I care about forward progress and am willing to make
    decisions and establish collaboration and enthusiasm around that decision.
- I absorb lots of **inputs** (colleague opinions, research, experience) and love to **ideate** about high level strategy. Give me some data and I will give you an idea.
- I do not suffer silently. I **express my needs frankly** and expect others to do
    the same.
- I make great efforts to **bring lightness** into my work. I try to laugh whenever
    I can and find opportunities to be silly together.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- Feedback helps me to thrive. The sooner I hear it, the better. A piece of feedback sounds
    something like "When I have seen you Y, then X."
- Judgement does not help me thrive. A judgement is something like "you are
    X".
- I _prefer_ that feedback is a two-way communication rather than an air-drop.
- I _prefer_ for that communication to be in the style of [connected
    communication](http://www.communicationdojo.com/connected-conversation-process-instructional-video/).
- Having my work be seen, understood, and evaluated is gratifying. If it is
    also then worthy of positive comment, even more.

## Work Patterns

- I _struggle_ to **pair program** but _aspire_ to do it more.
- I like to plan out my work day first thing when I get up and stick to that
    plan.
- I go to the gym in the mornings and am usually at work by 9:30am.
- When I need time to put things together, I like to go for a walk or a run.

## Communication Preferences

- If I have headphones on, please ping me on Slack rather than walk up to me.
- If we are in conflict, let's talk face to face.
- In meetings, I prefer to know if it's an ideation meeting, a consensus
    building meeting, an action planning meeting, a reflection meeting, or
    a status meeting. I do not like to have multiple types of meetings at once.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

- If I say that I am "uncomfortable" then I am.
- When I am having trouble holding still, I am not in a "flow" state and am
    trying to find a path forward.

### How to help

- If I say I am uncomfortable, I want to be engaged in what's happening for me
    since I will not be productive or engaged until I am comfortable.
- [Rubber ducking](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) with me helps when I am stuck.
- Giving me alone time and space to process also helps.

## Me Being Me

- You know that feeling right before a test in school when you just crammed
    a bunch of information last-minute into your brain and you need to hold it
    all there carefully like a house of cards before you get through the test
    otherwise you will lose it all? I feel like that most of the time and
    avoid people when I am trying to hold my fragile understanding of something
    in my head.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

- I do not like when people horde work or start a project secretly. See above
    value of "co-creation".
- I do not respond well to avoidance and passive aggressiveness. It triggers
    deep pain.
- Verbalizations, gestures, and noises that convey "yep, got it! next" shut me
    down in an unpleasant way.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

- Short term: fully realize the service strategy that will allow us to scale
    the team and product's vision while stabilizing our APIs.
- Long term: be a part of higher-level strategy around scaling tech and
    culture. Ultimately, a COO. Also, write a book.

## Areas for Development

- I do not respond with curiosity the way I would like. I am working on it.
- Details
- My focus is all over the place. I can't decide if I should put my energy into
    building things or planning and describing things.
- I have not found a way to collaborate with groups outside of engineering.

## Ask Me About

- Star Trek
- Living in community and community structures
- My writing
- My comedy
- Things that have helped my personal growth
